recipeapp is a small application for playing around with cooking recipes. The recipes are stored using JSON. There is a own git repository for the recipes: (git@github.com:magomi/recipebase.git or http://github.com/magomi/recipebase - check the recipes/json directory).

Currently all available recipes can be selected from a drop down list and will be displayed at the page.

The application is available at the following url: http://recipesforgeeks.appspot.com/
